## Role and stop condition

The integration manager turns the approved plan in
[#452](https://github.com/PureCutCNC/purecutcnc/issues/452) into sequential
worktree slices, independently reviews and verifies each slice, and merges only
accepted commits into the integration branch. Stop condition: all six phases
merged into the integration branch, green build, one PR opened against `main`
with `Closes #452`.

## Integration state

- Integration branch: `feat/issue-452-region-domain`
- Integration worktree: `/Users/frankp/Projects/worktrees/purecutcnc/optimistic-cannon-2e722c`
- Base commit: `240e15be1d61649b0fc18221031a18012910c156`
- Approved issue and plan: https://github.com/PureCutCNC/purecutcnc/issues/452#issuecomment-5199629410
- Manager session: 2026-08-05
- Status: `PR opened 2026-08-06; partial manual regression done, remainder accepted by the user`
- User authorization for credential-backed worker dispatch: `granted 2026-08-05 for all six slices of this issue`

## Global rules

- One active implementation slice at a time.
- Every worker runs in its own task worktree branched from the current
  integration tip, never in the integration checkout.
- The worker may use `bypassPermissions` only through the project launcher in
  explicit implementation mode.
- The manager owns worktree/branch creation, review, merge, cleanup, issue-plan
  updates, browser regression, push, and PR decisions.
- Reject any worker result without exactly one expected task commit, a clean
  task worktree, scoped changes, and truthful required-check results.
- `src/engine/toolpaths/**` is a protected path: full lane, never fast lane.
  Every slice needs focused unit tests and a green `npm run build`.

## Design contract for every slice

The full model lives in the approved issue comment. The load-bearing points a
worker must not re-derive:

1. **Regions resolve into the operation's domain before generation.** No
   post-generation move filtering. Generators become region-unaware.
2. **The domain is typed.** Area operations intersect polygons; curve
   operations split guides into ordered open spans; drilling filters points.
   Never apply area intersection to a curve domain — it turns the region's edge
   into a machined contour.
3. **Polarity implies the mode; there is no new user-facing control.**
   `include` → coverage (`D ∩ (R ⊕ r)`), `exclude` → containment (`D \ X`).
4. **`r` is the operation's effective centre inset** (`tool.radius +
   stockToLeaveRadial`), computed once per operation and reused. Two
   approximations of one clearance is how a seam becomes a gouge.
5. **`masked output ⊆ unmasked output`** in both polarities, always. Coverage
   over-reach is bounded by the operation's own domain `D`, never by the region,
   so a region can only narrow what gets cut and can never introduce a cut.
6. **Entry clearance regions and link-containment checks must be built from the
   masked domain**, not the original.
7. **Region boundaries never become cutting moves in their own right.**

Dependencies: p0 and p1 are independent of everything and of each other. p2, p3
and p4 each require p1. p5 requires p2, p3 and p4.

## Worker protocol notes

- **p0 reported `STATUS: complete` with `COMMIT: none`.** The diff, tests and
  build gate were all correct and independently verified, but the worker left
  the work staged-but-uncommitted. The manager committed the reviewed diff and
  merged. Subsequent prompts state the one-commit requirement explicitly and in
  stronger terms; if the pattern repeats, treat it as a launcher-level problem
  rather than a per-slice one.

## The Edge Route clearance rule (found by user testing, fixed in p6)

Every operation behaves the same way at a region boundary: an **include** region
lets the **tool centre** reach the line (the cut then sweeps a tool radius past,
unavoidably); an **exclude** region keeps the **tool body** clear. Edge Route did
not, and user testing caught it — trochoidal cut about a full cut width past an
include boundary and stopped short of an exclude one.

Cause: p4 used `trochoidalGuideOffset` (`= stockToLeave + cutWidth/2 + 0.01·D`)
as the region clearance and **dilated by it in both polarities**. A trochoidal
guide is not the tool-centre path — the tool centre orbits at `orbitRadius`
around it — so the correct clearances are:

- include → **erode** by `orbitRadius`
- exclude → **dilate** by `orbitRadius + tool.radius`

Contour Edge Route is the same rule with `orbitRadius = 0`: include `0`
(already correct), exclude `tool.radius` (was `0`, so the kerf crossed an
exclude boundary by a full radius — same defect class, fixed in the same slice).

The approved plan said this from the start: *"where a generator has a
centre-offset of its own — e.g. a trochoidal orbit radius — the domain should be
inset by that offset so tool-centre containment stays identical."*

`trochoidalGuideOffset` remains correct and unchanged for its original uses:
retained wall, obstacles, tabs. Only the region clearance moved.

Note that `resolveRegionDomainCurve` originally ignored negative offsets
(`centreInset > 0` guard), so an erosion request silently did nothing. It now
takes separate include/exclude offsets, with the exclude defaulting to the
include so other callers are unchanged.

## Before the PR opens — required manual regression

All seven slices are merged and `npm run build` is green on the integration
branch (165 unit test files). What is **not** yet done is a real look at the
generated toolpaths. Two slices in this run shipped code whose unit tests passed
while the safety property they claimed to check did not hold, so a green suite is
not sufficient evidence here.

Open a project with regions and check each of these in the app:

1. **Pocket** with an include region — concentric offsets of the masked shape
   with rounded corners and its own entry, not fragments stopping dead at the
   region edge. This is the case from the issue thread screenshot.
2. **Pocket / surface clean** with an exclude region — the cutter stays fully
   out, not merely centred outside it.
3. **V-carve** with an include region — watch the surface bleed described below;
   this is the one open semantic question.
4. **Edge Route (contour)** across a region boundary and across an obstacle —
   spans retract, rapid, and descend through air. No vertical plunge into stock.
5. **Trochoidal Edge Route** with both polarities — helical entry per surviving
   span, short spans skipped with a located warning rather than failing the job.
6. **Rest machining** with a region, since p5 changed its include semantics from
   containment to coverage.

**Verified 2026-08-06:** items 4 and 5 (contour and trochoidal Edge Route, both
polarities, plus obstacle and clamp interaction). The Edge Route clearance rule
below was found and fixed during that testing.

**Not yet exercised in the app when the PR was opened:** item 1 (pocket include —
the screenshot case from the issue), 2 (pocket / surface clean exclude), 3
(V-carve include and its depth-dependent surface bleed), 6 (rest machining, whose
include semantics changed from containment to coverage in p5). All are covered by
unit tests but not by eye. The user accepted that risk to get the branch merged;
if a region bug turns up in one of those four, start here.

**A region is not a hard keep-out.** A region bounds the tool *centre* (the guide,
for edge routing), so the cutter reaches up to a tool radius past the line — half
a cut width on a trochoid. An exclude region must therefore be drawn at least
that much larger than whatever it protects.

Confirmed on a real project 2026-08-06: a 1/4" endmill at the default trochoidal
width (`1.5 × D = 0.375"`) overlaps the region edge by `W/2 = 0.1875"`. A clamp
inside that band was crossed by 30 cut moves and 3 rapids; growing the region by
1/4" cleared it. An earlier note here claimed a region *was* effectively a
keep-out — that was wrong, based on one test whose region happened to be drawn
wide enough.

Do **not** fix this by dilating exclude regions: it would break include/exclude
tiling (see the Edge Route section above). The correct fix is that clamps should
not depend on a hand-drawn region at all — no generator avoids them at generation
time, they are only a post-pass in `clamps.ts` that warns and lifts rapids where
it can. Clamp footprints belong in the forbidden set the generators already use
for obstacles. Tracked separately, not in #452.

Note also that `applyClampWarnings` refuses to auto-lift a rapid whose endpoint
lies inside the clamp's expanded footprint (`clamp + clampClearanceXY +
toolRadius`), because lifting would still descend into the clamp at the far end.
So once cuts reach a clamp, neighbouring rapids stop lifting too — the warnings
compound rather than appearing in isolation.

## CLOSED — V-carve region regression (p3a → fixed in p3b `2607ce1`)

Fixed in `vcarve.ts` and `vcarveMedial/index.ts` by resolving the mask into the
band domain before generation, mirroring pocket's seam. Guarded by
`v_carve:`/`v_carve_medial: include region constrains cut area (regression
guard)` in `camOperationSmoke.test.ts`, both observed failing before the fix.

**Open semantic question for the user.** V-carve cut width is depth-dependent
(half-width `d·slope`), so one 2D region cannot bound both the tool centre and
the cut at every depth. p3b passes `centreInset = maxCarveDepth · slope`, which
means the *full-depth* pass reaches the region boundary exactly while shallower
passes over-reach by `(maxCarveDepth − currentDepth)·slope`. On a deep V-groove
that is a visible surface bleed beyond the drawn line — bounded by the
operation's own domain, so never a new cut, but worth a look before release.
Exclude containment is unaffected and correct at every depth, because the
generator's erosion tracks the depth-dependent width.

The historical record of the regression follows.

### What happened

p3a removed the `applyRegionMaskToPaths` block at `resolver.ts:442`. For Edge
Route that was correct — it was a duplicate, and a third semantic besides
(it masked design geometry *before* the tool offset, so the centre landed a
radius outside the region). But `resolvePocketRegions` has three consumers:
`pocket.ts`, `restRegions.ts`, and **`vcarve.ts`**, and for V-carve that block
was the *only* region masking in the whole pipeline.

`vcarve.ts` contains no region handling, `vcarveMedial/` contains none, and
`generateVCarveToolpath` is wired straight into `useToolpathGeneration.ts` with
nothing clipping its output. So `v_carve` and `v_carve_medial` currently ignore
region filters entirely.

The worker rewrote `vcarveLineResolver.test.ts` to assert the unmasked area and
justified it by crediting `carving.ts` — but `carving.ts` exports
`generateFollowLineToolpath`, a different generator. The resolver-level assertion
is now factually right; what is missing is any end-to-end test that V-carve
output respects a region at all. That absence is what let this through.

p3b restores it at the generator and adds the missing end-to-end coverage.

## `resolveRegionDomainArea` has a precondition — know which seam you are at

Its exclude branch subtracts the region **raw**, relying on the generator to
erode the whole domain by `centreInset` afterwards. That erosion is what creates
the clearance. The function is therefore only valid at a **pre-erosion** seam:

- `pocket.ts` — passes `tool.radius + stockToLeaveRadial`, band generators inset
  by the identical `initialInset`. Correct.
- `surfaceStepdown3d.ts` — passes `initialInset`, then insets by `initialInset`
  via `buildInsetRegions`. Correct.
- `surface.ts` — **does not qualify.** `buildSurfaceCoverageRegions` has already
  expanded by the tool radius, so `coverageRegions` *is* the tool-centre domain
  and only `radialLeave` erosion remains. p2 passed `centreInset = 0` here, so
  excludes got no clearance at all and the cutter swept a full tool radius into
  excluded areas. p2b adds `resolveRegionDomainCentre` (both polarities dilate,
  as in the curve case) and switches this seam to it.

Masking *before* the expansion is not an alternative fix — `expand(subject \ X,
toolRadius)` pushes the domain back toward `X` and puts the centre in deeper.

Review lesson: p2's exclude tests asserted only that no cut **centre** landed
inside the excluded polygon, which is the pre-#452 semantic and passes even when
the tool body penetrates. Containment tests must assert distance `>= tool.radius
+ stockToLeaveRadial` from the exclude boundary, not mere non-containment.

## Debt to clear before the PR

- `regionDomain.ts` duplicates ~90 lines of geometry predicates from
  `guideFragments.ts` (`segmentIntersectionParams`, `pointInWorldPath`,
  `distinctSorted`, `pointAt`, `sameWorldPoint`, `normalizeWorldPath`). The
  copies are semantically identical — both use `XY_EPSILON = 1e-9`, verified at
  review — but two copies of subtle geometry predicates will drift. p1's prompt
  forbade touching `guideFragments.ts`, which forced the duplication; that was a
  prompt defect, not a worker one. **p3 owns the fix**: export the shared helpers
  from `guideFragments.ts` and delete the copies.

## Notes

- Dispatch from this worktree requires
  `DEEPSEEK_AGENT_ENV_FILE=/Users/frankp/Projects/purecutcnc/.env.agent` —
  `.env.agent` exists only in the primary checkout.
- `--base feat/issue-452-region-domain` on every dispatch and finish; the script
  default (`feat/core-arch-simplification`) is the wrong branch for this work.
