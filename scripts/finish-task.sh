Usage: scripts/finish-task.sh --slug SLUG [--base BRANCH] [--allow-main] [--keep-worktree]

Merge an approved slice's branch into the integration branch (--no-ff) and remove
its worktree. Run only after reviewing the diff produced by dispatch-task.sh.

Options:
  --slug SLUG       Slug used at dispatch (locates worktree $PURECUT_WORKTREE_BASE/SLUG).
  --base BRANCH     Integration branch to merge into (default: feat/core-arch-simplification).
  --allow-main      Permit merging into main/master (refused by default).
  --keep-worktree   Merge but do not remove the worktree/branch afterwards.
  --help            Show this help.

Safety: refuses if the worktree has uncommitted changes, if the integration
checkout is dirty, or (without --allow-main) if --base is main/master.
