/**
 * Themeable canvas colour palette, resolved from the active theme.
 *
 * The canvas draws with `CanvasRenderingContext2D`, which cannot read CSS custom
 * properties, so these colours cannot come from `var(--...)` the way the DOM
 * chrome does. They are theme tokens — and therefore user-editable in the Theme
 * Editor — carried here through the palette. `SketchCanvas` calls
 * `setCanvasPalette` once at the top of each render pass; every primitive helper
 * reads from this module instead of the hex literals it used to hardcode.
 *
 * A single per-frame module value is used rather than threading the palette
 * through ~90 call sites: the canvas has exactly one active theme per frame, and
 * the whole scene is repainted synchronously after `setCanvasPalette` runs.
