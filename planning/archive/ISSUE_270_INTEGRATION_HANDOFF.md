# Integration Handoff — Issue #270 SVG/DXF path and nesting semantics

> This tracked handoff is the implementation ledger for the approved plan in
> [GitHub issue #270](https://github.com/PureCutCNC/purecutcnc/issues/270).
> The issue remains the product plan and source of truth. Do not store tokens,
> raw environment values, or provider debug output here.

## Role and stop condition

The integration manager delegates the approved work as sequential slices,
reviews the actual commit and diff from every slice, and merges only accepted
work into the integration branch. After all slices pass repository and browser
verification, push the integration branch and open a PR with `Closes #270`.
Do not merge the PR into `main`.

## Integration state

- Integration branch: `feat/issue-270-svg-dxf-import-integration`
- Integration worktree: `/Users/frankp/Projects/worktrees/purecutcnc/issue-270-svg-dxf-import-integration`
- Base commit: `276245e7fcc462fac3c30fd4d51e60ca4178bf6d`
- Latest main merged: `fe569dd` (PR #278)
- Approved plan: GitHub issue #270
- Manager session: 2026-07-09 through 2026-07-12
- Status: `verified; PR ready for user testing`
- User authorization: plan and full implementation approved; credential read,
  outbound DeepSeek access, and bypass worker dispatch explicitly approved;
  direct manager implementation is also explicitly allowed when it is faster
  or produces better quality

## Approved product decisions

- `line` may hold open or closed geometry, is machinable path geometry, and
  never contributes material to the boolean model.
- Engrave follows open or closed Line geometry directly.
- V-carve and recursive V-carve accept Subtract features and closed Lines, but
  reject open Lines. Multiple selected closed Lines use even-odd topology.
- SVG Auto uses paint intent: stroke-only becomes Line; filled closed shapes
  use nesting-aware solid classification.
- DXF Auto defaults to Solid regions (infer nesting), preserving the established
  material-oriented DXF import behavior. Paths remains an explicit choice.
- Solid nesting is parent-before-child: depth 0 Add, depth 1 Subtract, then
  alternating by depth. Open profiles remain Line.
- Manual inference affects only a newly completed closed feature and never
  silently reclassifies existing work.
- The user-supplied Aztec files stay uncommitted; synthetic fixtures cover tests.

## Global rules

- One active implementation slice at a time.
- Every slice runs in its own task worktree branched from the current
  integration tip.
- The canonical credential remains only in the primary checkout
  `/Users/frankp/Projects/purecutcnc/.env.agent`.
- The manager owns review, verification, merge, cleanup, browser regression,
  push, issue status, and PR creation.
- Reject results without exactly one expected task commit, a clean worktree,
  scoped changes, and truthful check results.
- Preserve the public `ProjectStore` contract unless a slice explicitly
  requires a typed input extension already allowed by the contract.
- Use shared pure helpers for feature roles, V-carve eligibility, and nesting
  semantics; do not duplicate policy across UI/store/resolver call sites.
- New source and test files require the Apache 2.0 header.
- Update the nearest `INDEX.md` when files are added or responsibilities move.
- Final browser work must cover desktop and tablet-sized layouts. Close the
  controlled browser before stopping the dev server.

## S1 — Closed Line is a first-class non-solid feature

**Goal:** A closed profile can be Line without coercion, remains machinable, is
excluded from CSG/fallback extrusion, and appears as a 3D line overlay.

**Likely allowed files:**

- `src/store/helpers/featureRoles.ts` and focused tests
- `src/store/slices/featureSlice.ts`
- `src/components/feature-tree/FeatureTree.tsx`
- `src/components/feature-tree/PropertiesPanel.tsx`
- `src/engine/csg.ts` and focused tests
- nearest relevant `INDEX.md`

**Forbidden:** V-carve resolver changes, import modes/classifier, manual nesting
inference, broad UI redesign, line batching.

**Invariants:**

- Region, Construction, Model, and open-Line behavior remain unchanged.
- The first remaining solid feature must still be Add; a Lines-only project is
  valid.
- Single and bulk operation changes must not create a leading Subtract solid.

**Checks:** focused feature-role/store/CSG tests, then `npm run build`.

## S2 — Closed Lines as V-carve targets

**Goal:** Both V-carve strategies accept closed Lines with even-odd contour
topology while preserving existing Subtract/add-island and region-mask behavior.

**Likely allowed files:**

- `src/components/cam/operationValidity.ts` and tests
- `src/components/cam/CAMPanel.tsx`
- `src/store/helpers/operationDefaults.ts` and tests
- `src/engine/toolpaths/resolver.ts` and resolver/toolpath tests
- small shared feature-role/eligibility helper modules if justified

**Forbidden:** import dialog/modes, manual creation defaults, 3D batching.

**Invariants:**

- Open Lines remain invalid for V-carve and valid for Engrave.
- Persisted target validation, fallback target selection, compatible selection,
  UI hints, and actual resolution agree.
- Closed Line paths are not normalized into one same-winding non-zero fill.

**Checks:** operation validity/default/resolver/V-carve focused tests, then
`npm run build`.

## S3 — Import meaning, SVG intent, and nesting-aware creation

**Goal:** SVG/DXF import exposes Auto, Paths, and Solid regions; Auto follows the
approved SVG/DXF defaults; a pure classifier creates deterministic
parent-before-child Add/Subtract nesting and the dialog shows an analysis/result
summary.

**Likely allowed files:**

- `src/import/types.ts`, `src/import/svg.ts`, import tests
- a new focused nesting/import-classification helper and tests
- `src/store/slices/importMergeSlice.ts`, store types/tests as needed
- `src/components/project/ImportGeometryDialog.tsx`
- relevant dialog CSS
- `e2e/*.smoke.spec.ts` and helpers
- nearest relevant `INDEX.md`

**Forbidden:** workerization without measurement, committing the Aztec files,
manual drawing inference, unrelated import repair.

**Invariants:**

- SVG Auto: stroke-only Line; filled closed shapes nesting-aware solids.
- DXF Auto: nesting-aware solids. Paths is explicit.
- Classification spans the selected import batch across layers, uses strict
  smallest-container parentage, preserves sibling source order, and warns on
  ambiguity.
- Open imported profiles remain Line.

**Checks:** focused import/store tests, relevant e2e smoke, then
`npm run build`.

## S4 — Large-import performance and batched 3D Lines

**Goal:** The 2,980-contour workload avoids quadratic bulk creation patterns,
multi-thousand-item selection/expanded tree behavior, boolean work for Lines,
and thousands of 3D draw calls.

**Likely allowed files:**

- `src/store/slices/importMergeSlice.ts` and bulk-import tests
- naming/ID helpers only if a focused bulk API is needed
- `src/engine/csg.ts`
- `src/components/viewport3d/Viewport3D.tsx` if scene ownership changes
- focused 3D/bulk tests and nearest `INDEX.md`

**Forbidden:** changing CAM geometry tolerances, importing the private Aztec
files as fixtures, speculative parse worker.

**Invariants:**

- Large folders start collapsed and select the folder/representative item, not
  every child.
- Line overlay batching uses a small number of BufferGeometry/line draw calls
  and disposes GPU resources through the existing scene lifecycle.
- Selected/hovered feedback remains correct or uses a small overlay.
- Measure after bulk/CSG/batching changes; add a worker only with evidence.

**Checks:** focused bulk/CSG tests, a synthetic large-import benchmark/assertion,
then `npm run build`.

## S5 — Manual closed-feature nesting defaults

**Goal:** Newly completed closed features default outside → Add, inside Add →
Subtract, inside Subtract → Add using the shared classifier primitives.

**Likely allowed files:**

- shared nesting/containment helper from S3
- `src/store/helpers/buildShapeFeature.ts`
- `src/store/slices/pendingAddSlice.ts`
- `src/store/slices/pendingCompletionSlice.ts`
- primitive creation paths and focused store tests

**Forbidden:** retroactively changing existing features, a reclassify command,
changing explicit user-selected operations.

**Invariants:**

- Ignore Line, Region, Construction, and Model for inference.
- Explicit operation choice wins.
- Undo/redo and linked-definition behavior remain correct.
- Later outer shapes do not reclassify earlier inner shapes.

**Checks:** focused creation/store tests, then `npm run build`.

## Integration verification

- `npm run build`
- `npm run test:e2e`
- Browser import dialog smoke on desktop and tablet-sized viewports
- Import the supplied SVG in Auto/Paths and confirm no boolean-preview failure
- Import the supplied DXF with Auto and Paths; confirm the selected result
  summary and no multi-thousand-item selection
- Closed Line conversion plus Engrave/V-carve eligibility smoke
- 3D view interaction after large Paths import
- Close controlled browser, then stop the dev server

### Completed verification — 2026-07-12

- `npm run build` passed: lint, license headers, TypeScript, all 103 test
  files, and the production Vite bundle.
- `npm run test:e2e` passed all 22 Playwright tests, including SVG/DXF
  Auto/Paths/Solid regions wiring and the landscape-tablet import dialog.
- Real Aztec SVG Paths: 2,980 closed Lines, one collapsed folder, one selected
  row, interactive 3D drag, no console errors; about 71 seconds end to end.
- Real Aztec DXF Paths: 2,980 closed Lines, one collapsed folder, one selected
  row, interactive 3D drag, no console errors; about 89 seconds end to end.
- Real Aztec DXF Auto: 2,749 Add and 231 Subtract features, one collapsed
  folder, one selected row, one invalid/self-intersection warning, no console
  errors; about 171 seconds end to end.
- The real-file run exposed expensive impossible contour comparisons. Commit
  `5286bb5` adds bbox/area rejection plus a 2,980-contour DXF Auto regression.
- The private user files remain untracked and uncommitted. The controlled
  browser was closed before the dev server, and port 1420 was confirmed free.

### Follow-up verification — closed Line sketch rendering

- Closed Line profiles now render as strokes in Sketch rather than filled
  regions, matching their non-solid role in the 3D view.
- Desktop and landscape-tablet toolbars now expose a dedicated Line creation
  target; open and closed shapes created in that mode remain Line features.
- Ordinary unselected Lines are submitted to the 2D canvas in bounded batches
  of 128 features. Selection, hover, edit, operation-highlight, and feature-info
  behavior keep their individual rendering paths.
- A real 2,980-contour Aztec SVG probe reduced a representative zoom redraw
  from 6,292 stroke submissions to 380, with about 259 ms zoom latency. A
  five-step pan used 1,330 strokes in about 746 ms. The remaining cost is the
  source drawing's roughly 114,840 vector segments; no console errors occurred.
- `npm run build` passed lint, license headers, TypeScript, all 108 structural
  test files, and the production Vite bundle.
- `npm run test:e2e` passed all 26 Playwright tests after merging current
  `main`, including the new desktop and landscape-tablet Line creation target
  coverage and `main`'s G-code export smoke.
- The reported transient red, green, and blue 3D lines match the intentional
  machine-origin X/Y/Z triad. Grid helpers use gray/blue-gray colors, so no
  speculative 3D change was made without a reproducible defect.
- Playwright, its temporary Vite server, and the controlled browser all exited;
  port 1420 was confirmed free after the final run.

Known limitation: Auto classification of this unusually complex DXF remains
synchronous and slow (about three minutes on the manager Mac), though it now
completes and remains geometrically classified. Paths is the recommended mode
when the design is intended as V-carve/engrave path geometry.

## User-review handoff

Final delivery is a PR from
`feat/issue-270-svg-dxf-import-integration` to `main`, with the accepted
slice list, exact verification commands, browser results, known limitations,
and `Closes #270`.
