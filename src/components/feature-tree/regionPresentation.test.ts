/**
 * Structural tests for the A1.4 "region as filter" UI treatment.
 *
 * These tests verify at the source level that:
 *   1. The CSS classes for the badge / note elements are defined in the stylesheet.
 *   2. FeatureTree renders one include/exclude badge only when operation is 'region'.
 *   3. CAMPanel renders the region-filter note when operationTargetsRegion is true,
 *      and the copy matches the agreed wording.
 *   4. PropertiesPanel shows the Z-lock and region note for region features.
 *
 * This approach (reading source files in the test) catches class-name typos,
 * removed conditionals, and copy drift without requiring a DOM renderer.
 *
 * Run with: npx tsx src/components/feature-tree/regionPresentation.test.ts
