# e2e — Browser Smoke (Playwright)

Thin, repeatable browser smoke run before manual testing sessions and in PR CI.
Covers DOM render + menu→action wiring. Does **NOT** assert geometry,
pixels, or WebGL canvas contents — those are owned by `npm test`.

## Quick start

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

Starts a `vite dev` server on port 1420 (if one isn't running) and
discovers all `e2e/*.spec.ts` files. The fixture auto-navigates to the
app, waits for the canvas, and fails the test on **any** `console.error`
or uncaught page error.

## CI gate

Pull requests run `npm run test:e2e` in a dedicated workflow job. CI installs
Chromium with Playwright, forbids committed `.only` tests, keeps traces on
failure, and uploads `playwright-report/` / `test-results/` when the job fails.
The e2e job is separate from `npm run build` so the build script stays
browser-free while PRs still exercise the browser smoke.

## Scaffolding (read before writing a test)

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `fixtures.ts` | Playwright `test` extension. Every spec imports `test` / `expect` from **here**, not `@playwright/test`. Provides `app` (booted page + error guard) and `ui` (selector module). |
| `selectors.ts` | **Single source of truth** for DOM selectors. Logical name → `Locator`. When the UI moves a class, update it **here** — every spec picks it up. |
| `helpers.ts` | Generic primitives: `seedProject`, `getProject`, `getHoveredFeatureId`, `getPendingMove`, `completePendingMove`, `openRowContextMenu`, `clickMenuItem`, `rowByName`, `featureRowCount`, `assertNoConsoleErrors`. Domain-agnostic. |
| `featureReferences.helpers.ts` | FR-specific helpers (e.g. `seedLinkedProject`). Built on the generic primitives. A new feature area gets its own `<area>.helpers.ts`. |
| `camOperations.helpers.ts` | CAM-specific fixture helpers for operation workflow smoke tests. |
| `gcodeExport.helpers.ts` | Export-dialog fixture: tool + two toolpath-producing operations + bundled GRBL machine selected. |

Current smoke targets:

- `featureReferences.smoke.spec.ts` — linked-feature tree badges, context menu wiring, properties grouping, and load round-trip.
- `camOperations.smoke.spec.ts` — feature-row quick operation wiring into CAM operation state.
- `creationTargets.smoke.spec.ts` — dedicated Line creation target wiring, active drawing badge, and landscape-tablet availability.
- `gcodeExport.smoke.spec.ts` — Export G-code dialog operation checklist: per-operation entry point, default set, none-selected disabled state.
- `importGeometry.smoke.spec.ts` — real-user import flow: dialog open/close, button state, file upload via hidden input, SVG/DXF mode selection with classification summary verification (Auto/Paths/Solid regions), real Import button, project-role verification through existing `getProject` seam, and landscape tablet layout. Synthetic inline fixtures only.
- `overlapFeatureSelection.smoke.spec.ts` — direct selection for clear outline clicks, ambiguous-overlap picker wiring, candidate hover/focus previews, non-topmost selection, boxed scroll behavior, next-action dismissal, and landscape-tablet availability.

## Adding a test

The canonical shape for a new feature-area smoke:

1. **One spec file** per feature area: `e2e/<feature>.smoke.spec.ts`
2. **Import `test` / `expect` from `./fixtures`** (never `@playwright/test`)
3. **All selectors via `ui`** (the `selectors.ts` module)
4. **Seed via `seedProject`** (or an area helper that wraps it)
5. **Drive wiring via real clicks** through helpers (`openRowContextMenu`, `clickMenuItem`)
6. **Assert via the DOM** — never canvas contents, never geometry values
7. **Console-error guard is automatic** (from the fixture — no per-test boilerplate)
8. **Area-specific selectors** that don't yet exist in `selectors.ts` are added there; everything else is handled by the existing scaffolding.

User-facing UI or workflow changes should add or extend an e2e smoke when the
behavior depends on rendered DOM, menu wiring, dialogs, or browser-only boot
paths. If store/unit coverage is enough, call that out in the PR description so
the omission is intentional.

### Worked example — hypothetical "CAM operations" smoke

```ts
// e2e/camOperations.smoke.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from './fixtures'
import { seedProject, rowByName, openRowContextMenu, clickMenuItem } from './helpers'

test('pocket operation appears in context menu', async ({ app, ui }) => {
  await seedProject(app.page, CAM_FIXTURE_JSON)         // defined in camOperations.helpers.ts
  const row = rowByName(app.page, 'Pocket Feature')
  const menu = await openRowContextMenu(app.page, row)
  await expect(ui.contextMenu.item(menu, 'Pocket')).toBeVisible()
  await clickMenuItem(menu, 'Pocket')
  // … assert DOM reacts: operation tree entry, properties panel, etc.
})
```

**That's it.** No harness-internal changes, no duplicate boot/guard logic,
no raw selectors. The fixture + helpers absorb everything.

## Tauri boot caveat

The app runs in plain Chromium because `src/platform/index.ts` falls back
to the browser platform when `window.__TAURI_INTERNALS__` is absent. If a
future change adds Tauri IPC calls at boot time that are not guarded by
`isDesktop`, the smoke will break. Fix the guard — don't mock Tauri.

## Explicit non-goals

- No geometry/coordinate/segment-kind assertions (store suites own that).
- No screenshot/pixel diffing; no WebGL canvas-content assertions.
- No Tauri native file-dialog flows — project state is seeded via the
  guarded `window.__pcTest` dev seam.
