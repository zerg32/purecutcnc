 * Discrete sketch-view overlay showing which drawing mode (creation target)
 * is active — Features / Lines / Regions / Construction (issues #199/#270).
 * With four modes, the highlighted toolbar button alone is easy to miss; this badge
 * keeps the answer to "what will I draw right now?" in the corner of the
 * canvas. Display-only: pointer events pass through to the canvas.
