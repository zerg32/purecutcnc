# Integration Handoff — Multi-language support (issue #314)

> Execution ledger for the delegated slices of issue #314. The GitHub issue is
> the approved plan and source of truth; this file records execution state.
> No tokens, raw environment values, or unredacted provider output.

## Role and stop condition

The integration manager turns approved issue #314 into sequential worktree
slices, independently reviews and verifies each slice, and merges only accepted
commits into the integration branch. Delivery point: all six phases complete
and verified on the integration branch; then a single PR to `main` closing
#314 and #311. No PR before that.

## Integration state

- Integration branch: `feat/issue-314-multi-language`
- Integration worktree: `/Users/frankp/Projects/worktrees/purecutcnc/multi-language-support-editor-a58b4b`
- Base commit: `bd88b6b` (main at branch time)
- Approved issue and plan: `https://github.com/PureCutCNC/purecutcnc/issues/314`
- Manager session: Claude manager session, 2026-07-17
- Status: `all phases merged; final verification pending`
- User authorization for credential-backed worker dispatch: granted 2026-07-17
  in-session ("delegate work if appropriate" in the implementation kickoff).

## Global rules

- At most two concurrent implementation slices, and only when their
  allowed-file sets are fully disjoint. The locale registration files
  (`src/i18n/locales/en/index.ts`, `src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/index.ts`) are
  reserved to the manager, who registers new catalog modules at merge time —
  this removes the only shared-file conflict between extraction slices.
  (Amended 2026-07-18 from "one active slice" to increase throughput.)
- Every worker runs in its own task worktree branched from the current integration tip, never in the integration checkout.
- The worker may use `bypassPermissions` only through the project launcher in explicit implementation mode.
- The manager owns worktree/branch creation, review, merge, cleanup, issue-plan updates, browser regression, push, and PR decisions.
- Reject any worker result without exactly one expected task commit, a clean task worktree, scoped changes, and truthful required-check results.
- Browser- or tablet-affected work requires the applicable manual regression before the final user handoff. Tear down controlled Chrome before the dev server.

## Phase → slice map

Issue #314 phases and how they are executed:

| Phase | Execution |
| --- | --- |
| 1 — i18n core + selector + shell | Manager-implemented directly (S1) |
| 2 — sketch surfaces | Delegated as S2a (toolbars + command descriptors), S2b (canvas panels), S2c (feature tree + properties) |
| 3 — CAM + dialogs | Delegated; slices defined after S2 lands |
| 4 — remaining surfaces | Delegated; slices defined after S3 lands |
| 5 — structured engine warnings | Manager-implemented (CAM core; not delegated) |
| 6 — language manager/editor + docs | Manager-implemented (design-heavy; not delegated) |

## Slice instructions

### S2a — Sketch toolbars + command descriptors

**Goal:** Extract every user-facing string in the sketch-editing toolbars and
the shared command descriptors into the `src/i18n/` catalog (new `sketch`
module) with complete Simplified Chinese translations, changing no visible
English text and no behavior.

**Allowed files:**

- `src/commands/sketchCommands.ts`
- `src/commands/creationShapes.ts`
- `src/commands/INDEX.md`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/CreationActions.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/CreationToolbar.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/SketchEditActions.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/FeatureEditActions.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/AlignmentActions.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/ShapeToolActions.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/BackdropEditActions.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/ToolbarPopoverMenu.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/primitives.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/Toolbar.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/SnapToolbar.tsx`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/useToolbarState.ts`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/shared.ts`
- `src/components/layout/toolbar/INDEX.md`
- `src/i18n/locales/en/sketch.ts` (new)
- `src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/sketch.ts` (new)
- `src/i18n/locales/en/index.ts` (spread the new module only)
- `src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/index.ts` (spread the new module only)

**Forbidden files:**

- Everything else. In particular: the rest of `src/i18n/` (catalog, registry,
  selection, store, bootstrap, context, provider, shell modules, tests),
  `src/store/`, `src/engine/`, `src/types/`, `src/theme/`, `e2e/`,
  `playwright*`, `package.json`, and any file already extracted in phase 1.

**Invariants:**

- Pure extraction: every visible English string stays byte-identical; no copy
  rewrites, no behavior change, no markup restructuring beyond what key lookup
  requires.
- Presentation only: serialized identifiers, enum values, feature/tool ids,
  and store-bound strings (e.g. the literal `'Untitled'` default project
  name) are never translated or keyed.
- Keys live in a new `sketch` module mirroring phase 1's `shell` module:
  `locales/en/sketch.ts` exports `sketchEn` (`as const satisfies
  Record<string, string>`), `locales/zh-CN/sketch.ts` exports `sketchZhCN:
  Record<keyof typeof sketchEn, string>` (complete by type). Register both in
  the locale `index.ts` files by spreading, nothing more.
- Keys are permanent dot-namespaced ids (`sketch.…`); follow the naming style
  of `locales/en/shell.ts`.
- zh-CN terminology follows `src/i18n/GLOSSARY.md`; `{placeholder}` parity is
  mandatory (the registry test enforces it).
- No string surgery on translatable text: no `.replace()`, `.toLowerCase()`,
  or concatenation that assembles sentences. Restructure into dedicated keys
  or `{param}` interpolation exactly as phase 1 did in `MeasureActions.tsx`
  and `SnapPopover.tsx`.
- Module-level option/label lists become `labelKey` lists translated at render
  time with `useI18n()` (see phase-1 `SnapPopover.tsx`); non-hook modules use
  `translate` from `src/i18n/store.ts`.
- Count-bearing strings use `tPlural` with explicit `.one`/`.other` keys.
- Apache header on new files; strict TypeScript; update the nearest INDEX.md
  in the same commit when a file's purpose changes.

**Required checks:**

```bash
npm run build
```

**Manager review record:**

- Worker invocation: 2026-07-17. First dispatch failed pre-worker
  (`DEEPSEEK_API_KEY is not configured` — `.env.agent` lives only in the
  primary checkout); worktree was clean and removed. Retry with
  `DEEPSEEK_AGENT_ENV_FILE` pointed at the primary checkout succeeded,
  exit 0.
- Worker-reported completion: `STATUS: complete, COMMIT: f97a9f3, CHECKS:
  npm run build pass` (report only).
- Diff/commit review: pass. 13 in-scope files + one out-of-scope edit,
  `constructionPresentation.test.ts` — accepted as forced: it is a
  structural test asserting CreationActions source text, which extraction
  necessarily rewrites; assertion intent preserved. `noun` kept alongside
  `nounKey` deliberately — ToolRail (phase 4) still consumes the English
  noun. en byte-identity spot-verified via templates
  (`'Add {target} {shape}'` + lowercase nouns). Independent gate: passed.
- Correction attempts: none.
- Acceptance decision: `accepted` — merged `--no-ff` as `a55866a`.

### S2b — Canvas creation panels

**Goal:** Extract user-facing strings in the sketch-canvas UI (workflow/
creation panels, constraint + driving-dimension panels, gear panel, pickers,
badges, canvas context menu, manual entry) into a new `canvas` catalog module
with complete zh-CN, en byte-identical.

**Allowed files:** `src/components/canvas/{SketchCanvas,CanvasWorkflowPanel,ConstraintEditPanel,DrivingDimensionPanel,GearParameterPanel,CreationParameterReferences,CreationTargetBadge,OverlapFeaturePicker,DepthLegend}.tsx`,
`src/components/canvas/{useCanvasContextMenu,useCanvasWorkflowPanel,useDrivingDimensionWorkflow,useOverlapFeaturePicker,manualEntry}.ts`,
`src/components/canvas/SketchCanvas.types.ts`, `src/components/INDEX.md`,
`src/i18n/locales/en/canvas.ts` (new), `src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/canvas.ts`
(new), both locale `index.ts` (spread only).

**Forbidden:** canvas *rendering* modules that draw text into the 2D canvas
(`dimensionRendering.ts`, `operationSnapshot.ts`, `stlTopViewRenderer.ts`,
`draftGeometry.ts`, `previewPrimitives.ts`, `measurements.ts`) — numeric/
technical notation, deliberate boundary; all tests; rest of `src/i18n/`;
`src/store/`, `src/engine/`, `src/types/`, `e2e/`; files from earlier slices.

**Invariants:** as S2a (pure extraction, byte-identical en, GLOSSARY zh,
placeholder parity, no string surgery, `tPlural` for counts, Apache headers).

**Required checks:** `npm run build`

**Manager review record:**

- Worker invocation: 2026-07-17, exit 0; independent gate passed.
- Worker-reported completion: `STATUS: complete, COMMIT: 0834e63`; RISKS
  honestly flagged both boundary items below.
- Diff/commit review: pass. The two feature-tree structural tests were
  updated out of scope, but the change is forced (they read canvas component
  source) and strengthens them: each now asserts the component references
  the i18n key AND the en catalog carries the exact original English string.
  Verified `heldSideLabel` logic comparisons are untouched (labels never
  translated at the identifier level), so no behavior change.
- Known limitations logged: (1) linear/angle dimension-edit panels display
  the raw `heldSideLabel` ("Hold left" …) — untranslated because the fix
  needs a structured-id refactor in `src/sketch/drivingDimensionResolver.ts`
  (out of slice scope) → follow-up S2d; (2) canvas-drawn preview labels
  ("Pending rectangle", "Move preview") stay English inside the declared
  canvas-rendering boundary.
- Acceptance decision: `accepted` — merged `--no-ff` as `9b4f006`.

### S2c — Feature tree + properties

**Goal:** Extract user-facing strings in the feature tree, properties panel,
feature context menu, Z-range slider, and the construction/region
presentation-label modules into a new `featureTree` catalog module with
complete zh-CN, en byte-identical.

**Allowed files:** `src/components/feature-tree/{FeatureTree,PropertiesPanel,FeatureContextMenu,ZRangeSlider}.tsx`,
`src/components/feature-tree/{constructionPresentation,regionPresentation}.ts`,
`src/components/feature-tree/INDEX.md` (if present),
`src/i18n/locales/en/featureTree.ts` (new),
`src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/featureTree.ts` (new), both locale `index.ts`
(spread only).

**Forbidden:** `src/components/feature-tree/*.test.ts` — these assert the
exact current English output of the presentation modules and MUST pass
unchanged (a failing one means visible text changed); everything else as S2a.
Presentation modules are non-React: use `translate` from `src/i18n/store.ts`.

**Required checks:** `npm run build`

**Manager review record:**

- Worker invocation: 2026-07-17/18, exit 0; independent gate passed; RISKS: none.
- Diff/commit review: pass. ~170-key `featureTree` module, en byte-identity
  spot-verified, sanctioned structural-test strengthening only (component
  references key + en catalog carries original string). Note: the
  "constructionPresentation.ts / regionPresentation.ts" files listed as
  allowed did not exist — those names are standalone structural test SUITES,
  not modules; the slice instructions carried a manager assumption error the
  worker correctly handled.
- Acceptance decision: `accepted` — merged `--no-ff` as `16f1fd1`.

### S3a — CAM panel + operation reference (concurrent with S3b)

**Goal:** Extract user-facing strings in the CAM panels (tools, operations,
parameters, add menu, per-parameter reference copy) into a new `cam` catalog
module with complete zh-CN, en byte-identical.

**Allowed files:** `src/components/cam/CAMPanel.tsx`,
`src/components/cam/OperationParameterReference.tsx`,
`src/components/cam/OperationAddMenu.tsx`, any other `src/components/cam/*`
UI file, `src/components/INDEX.md` (only if a documented purpose changes),
`src/i18n/locales/en/cam.ts` (new), `src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/cam.ts` (new).

**Forbidden:** the locale `index.ts` registration files (manager registers at
merge — the new module will be intentionally unreferenced in this slice; the
build stays green because unregistered modules compile standalone), all
tests except sanctioned structural strengthening, the rest of `src/i18n/`,
`src/store/`, `src/engine/`, `src/toolLibrary.ts` serialized tool/operation
identifiers, `e2e/`, and every file from earlier slices.

**Invariants:** as earlier slices, plus: operation/tool TYPE identifiers and
serialized enum values are never keyed; only display labels are. Long-form
parameter reference copy is translatable prose — keep keys per parameter
(`cam.paramRef.<param>.…`).

**Required checks:** `scripts/build-summary.sh`

**Manager review record:** extraction and zh-CN quality accepted (gate
passed, en byte-identical). Defects — all traced to the register-at-merge
rule denying workers typed keys: a duplicate mini-i18n wrapper (`camI18n.ts`)
with no locale subscription. Corrected by manager in `9290cff`; the CAM
surfaces now re-render on language switch. Lesson (binding for phase 4+):
workers register their own catalog module in the locale index files — the
manager resolves the deterministic 2-line conflict between concurrent
slices at merge; per-file translation wrappers and any hardcoded locale
dispatch (`localeId === 'zh-CN' ? … : …`) are forbidden.

### S3b — Project/export/machine dialogs (concurrent with S3a)

**Goal:** Extract user-facing strings in the project dialogs (new/import/
text-tool/unit-conversion/examples), export dialogs (G-code, model, print),
and machine definition editor/manager into a new `dialogs` catalog module
with complete zh-CN, en byte-identical.

**Allowed files:** `src/components/project/*.tsx`,
`src/components/export/*.tsx` and pure helpers beside them,
`src/components/machine/*.tsx`, `src/components/INDEX.md` (only if a
documented purpose changes), `src/i18n/locales/en/dialogs.ts` (new),
`src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/dialogs.ts` (new).

**Forbidden:** the locale `index.ts` registration files (manager registers
at merge), all tests except sanctioned structural strengthening, the rest of
`src/i18n/`, `src/store/`, `src/engine/` (export/print content generation
stays untouched — dialogs only), `e2e/`, files from earlier slices.

**Invariants:** as earlier slices, plus: file names, file-type descriptors
passed to native pickers, units (mm/in symbols), G-code text, and
Zod-generated raw-JSON validation messages in the machine editor stay
English/technical (documented boundary — translate the form labels,
headings, buttons, and app-authored error summaries around them).

**Required checks:** `scripts/build-summary.sh`

**Manager review record:** extraction and zh-CN quality accepted (gate
passed); exportOperationSelection's reason-key refactor was exemplary.
Defects, same root cause as S3a: eleven per-dialog `td()` helpers hardcoded
`zh-CN` catalog dispatch (custom packs would never apply), six memoized
fragments lacked a locale dependency (stale translations after switching),
one hardcoded-locale singular/plural hack in ImportGeometryDialog.
Corrected by manager in `9290cff` (td → context `t`, `languageTag` deps,
dedicated noun keys). Verified: full gate + 17/17 language/appearance/CAM/
export e2e.

### S4a — App shell chrome (concurrent with S4b)

**Goal:** Extract user-facing strings in the app shell (status bar, drawers,
mode switching in `AppShell.tsx`), the tablet `ToolRail.tsx`, and
`ToolpathVisibilityPanel.tsx` into a new `appShell` catalog module with
complete zh-CN, en byte-identical.

**Allowed files:** `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx`,
`src/components/layout/ToolRail.tsx`, `src/components/layout/useShellMode.ts`,
`src/components/ToolpathVisibilityPanel.tsx`,
`src/i18n/locales/en/appShell.ts` (new), `src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/appShell.ts`
(new), and — unlike earlier slices — BOTH locale `index.ts` files, where you
add exactly one import and one spread line for your module (the manager
resolves the trivial conflict with the concurrent slice at merge).

**Binding rules (lessons from S3):** components translate via
`useI18n()`/`t` only — NO per-file translation wrapper helpers, NO module
`translate` in component render paths, NO hardcoded locale checks
(`localeId === 'zh-CN' ? … : …` is forbidden; missing singular/plural or
case variants get their own keys instead). ToolRail's aria-labels built by
string composition from `option.noun` must be restructured onto the existing
`sketch.creation.*` template keys and `nounKey`s (leave the `noun` field
itself in place). Memoized translated content must include `languageTag` in
its dependency array.

**Required checks:** `scripts/build-summary.sh`

**Manager review record:** accepted with one deviation. Worker followed every
S3-lesson rule (useI18n throughout, no wrappers, no hardcoded locale,
ToolRail composition restructured onto key-based nouns, registration lines
correct) and its gate passed — but ended with `COMMIT: none` (honestly
reported). Manager committed on the worker's behalf (`5c8abe8`) and merged
with a manual union of the concurrent registration conflict (`c87d192`).
Same omission in both S4 slices — likely the enlarged CRITICAL RULES block
displaced the commit instruction; future prompts must put "make exactly one
commit" inside that block.

### S4b — Viewports, about, onboarding, errors (concurrent with S4a)

**Goal:** Extract user-facing strings in `SimulationViewport.tsx` (and
simulation playback controls), `Viewport3D.tsx`, `about/AboutDialog.tsx`,
`onboarding/EmptyStateOverlay.tsx`, `AppErrorBoundary.tsx`,
`ErrorScreen.tsx`, and `errorFormat.ts` into a new `viewport` catalog module
with complete zh-CN, en byte-identical.

**Allowed files:** the files above, `src/i18n/locales/en/viewport.ts` (new),
`src/i18n/locales/zh-CN/viewport.ts` (new), and BOTH locale `index.ts`
files (one import + one spread line each; manager resolves the concurrent
conflict). `errorFormat.ts` renders pre-React fatal HTML — module
`translate` is correct THERE (no React); everywhere else the S4a binding
rules apply verbatim.

**Required checks:** `scripts/build-summary.sh`

**Manager review record:** accepted with the same `COMMIT: none` deviation
as S4a (honestly reported; gate passed; scope exact; `translate` correctly
confined to the pre-React `errorFormat.ts`). Manager committed on the
worker's behalf (`38cb80e`) and merged (`780be20`).

### S5 — Structured engine warnings (manager-implemented; DONE — `6f718b9` merged `4e5ff6f`; gate + 8/8 language/CAM/export e2e green. One test conversion initially over-narrowed a substring assertion to a single code — caught by the gate, widened to both matching codes.)

Contract (binding for the implementation, survives session summarization):

- `src/engine/toolpaths/warningCodes.ts` (new): `ToolpathWarningCode`
  string-literal union + `interface ToolpathWarning { code:
  ToolpathWarningCode; params?: Record<string, string | number> }`. The
  ENGINE owns codes and stays free of i18n imports (layering: engine pure,
  translation at presentation).
- `types.ts` both `warnings: string[]` fields and the postprocessor's
  local `warnings` become `ToolpathWarning[]` — the compiler then
  enumerates every push site (~90 across ~20 generator files +
  postprocessor). Each converts to `{ code, params }`; user-authored names
  and numbers travel as params, never baked into text.
- `src/i18n/locales/en/warnings.ts` + `zh-CN/warnings.ts` (new module,
  registered): one key per code (`warnings.<code>`), en values byte-equal
  to today's strings. A unit test imports the engine union and asserts the
  catalog covers every code (and no orphans).
- `src/i18n/warningText.ts` (new): `toolpathWarningText(w)` →
  `translate('warnings.' + w.code, w.params)` — the single presentation
  mapper. Consumers (CAMPanel warning list, ExportDialog preview warnings,
  operation booklet rendering) format at render time; the booklet follows
  the UI locale.
- Engine tests asserting warning STRINGS convert to code assertions
  (equivalent strength, mirrors the S2d test conversion).
- Checks: `scripts/build-summary.sh` + language/appearance/CAM/export e2e.

### S6 — Language manager + editor (manager-implemented; DONE — merged `1018d6a`)

Completed 2026-07-18 by the continuation manager session. Commits on
`feat/issue-314-s6-editor` (branched at `a8e3856`), merged `--no-ff` as
`1018d6a`:

- `249d3bf` languageManager catalog modules (prior session).
- `291f34f` LanguageManagerDialog + LanguageEditorDialog + LanguageControl
  manage entry + module registration + dialog CSS + INDEX entries.
- `468fe86` themeManager catalog module closing the theme-dialog extraction
  gap (en byte-identical + zh-CN).
- `5465af8` languageManager e2e smoke (3 tests) + `languageManager` /
  `languageEditor` selector groups.
- `67f52a9` ARCHITECTURE.md §9 Localization, i18n INDEX refresh, glossary.
- `fdf396b` importGeometry spec: baseURL from fixture (hardcoded :1420
  broke every fresh-port worktree run; found by the full-suite gate).

Checks: `scripts/build-summary.sh` PASS in the task worktree and again on
integration after merge; full e2e in the task worktree 66/66 (65 + the
fixed import spec rerun); language/languageManager/appearance/themeManager
e2e on integration 24/24. The predicted locale-index merge conflict did not
occur (no concurrent slice).

Design decisions of record:

- Editor Apply persists and closes but does NOT activate — activation stays
  the explicit "Use this language" action (deliberate divergence from the
  theme editor, matching the e2e contract; a half-translated pack is a
  state worth saving without living in it).
- "Preview in app" persists the draft once per press (no per-keystroke
  persistence) and activates the pack; Cancel restores the on-open snapshot
  and the previously active locale.
- Documented boundary (mirrors the S2b canvas-rendering boundary):
  registry-data labels stay English — built-in theme names and the theme
  token/group/contrast-check labels from `src/theme/tokens.ts` /
  `src/theme/contrast.ts`. The '42.5 mm' preview sample is numeric
  notation. Deeper extraction there would need a labelKey refactor of the
  theme system; out of S6 scope.
- `isValidLanguageTag()` exported from the registry for the editor's tag
  field.

Then the Final phase per the issue: full build + complete e2e suite on
integration, manual CJK layout pass (desktop + tablet), user review, and
ONE PR to `main` with "Closes #314" and "Closes #311" (no attribution
footer — repo rule).

## Integration verification

- Accepted commits and merge order: S1 `af0148c` → merge `ca0df27`; … ;
  S5 `6f718b9` → merge `4e5ff6f`; S6 (5 commits) → merge `1018d6a`.
- Repository checks: `scripts/build-summary.sh` PASS at `1018d6a`;
  language + languageManager + appearance + themeManager e2e 24/24 on a
  fresh-port dev server in the integration worktree.
- Browser/tablet checks: language switch, persistence, tablet touch targets
  covered by `e2e/language.smoke.spec.ts`; manager/editor flows by
  `e2e/languageManager.smoke.spec.ts`; full manual CJK layout pass happens
  in the final phase.
- Final verification (2026-07-18, post-S6-merge): complete e2e suite on the
  integration branch 66/66 against a fresh-port dev server. Manual CJK
  check in controlled Chrome (desktop 1440×900 + narrow 900×700): zh-CN
  shell/toolbars/tree/CAM/status bar, language manager + editor (duplicate
  简体中文 → base-reference rows → delete), theme manager + editor with the
  newly extracted strings — layouts clean, no clipped CJK, zero console
  errors. Declared-boundary English confirmed as intended (theme token/
  group/contrast labels, example-project metadata, numeric samples).
- Known limitations: none blocking — all six phases merged and verified.
  Awaiting user review before the single PR to `main`.

## User-review handoff

Produced after all phases complete and verify (single PR to `main` closing
#314 and #311; no PR before then).
