description: Run the integration-manager delegation loop — analyze a task, plan it in a GitHub issue, get approval, delegate implementation to the DeepSeek-backed Claude CLI worker in an isolated worktree, review the real diff, then merge into the integration branch. Use when acting as the manager session that dispatches bounded implementation slices rather than writing the code directly.

# manager-delegate

This skill encodes PureCutCNC's integration-manager loop: **you plan and review; a
DeepSeek-backed worker implements** one bounded slice at a time in its own git
worktree. You never let the worker's self-report stand in for acceptance — you
verify the real artifacts and own the merge.

Read `AGENTS.md` (§"DeepSeek implementation workers", §"Git & Branching",
§"Workflow: Issue → Plan → Approve → Implement → PR") first — it is authoritative.
This skill automates that documented flow; it does not replace those rules.

## The loop

1. **Analyze & plan in a GitHub issue.** Open an issue, write the plan in it,
   get the user's approval before implementing. No `planning/*_Plan.md` files —
   the issue is the plan of record. (See the issue-driven gate in AGENTS.md.)
2. **Write the handoff prompt.** Copy `scripts/claude-deepseek-agent-prompt.md`
   and fill every bracketed field for the slice (slice id, summary, allowed/
   forbidden files, invariants, required checks, plan + handoff paths). Those
   referenced paths must be **tracked files visible in the worktree** — never
   `work/` (gitignored, absent from worktrees). Save to a temp file.
3. **Request permission (see below), then dispatch.** Pipe the prompt into
   `scripts/dispatch-task.sh`. It creates the worktree+branch, runs the worker,
   runs an independent build gate, and reports — it does **not** merge.
   Run it in the background (redirect output to a file) and watch the slice's
   progress log instead of blocking a foreground call on the whole run (see
   "Watching a dispatched worker" below).
4. **Review the real diff, not the report.** The worker ends with a
   `STATUS/COMMIT/CHANGED_FILES/CHECKS/RISKS` block — that is a report, not
   acceptance. Inspect the actual worktree diff, the commit, and the build/test
   output, then run the checks in "Verify before you accept" below. Re-dispatch a
   correction slice if needed.
5. **Merge after approval.** Once you (and the user, when they want to see it)
   accept the diff, run `scripts/finish-task.sh` to merge `--no-ff` into the
   integration branch and tear down the worktree.

## Required permissions — request BEFORE dispatching

`dispatch-task.sh` needs three elevated capabilities at once:

1. **Read the credential file** `.env.agent` (the DeepSeek key).
2. **Outbound network** to the DeepSeek endpoint (`api.deepseek.com`).
3. **Spawn a `bypassPermissions` worker** `claude` process in the task worktree.

Sandboxed agents block network and the credential read by default. **Ask the user
for explicit approval for these three capabilities before invoking dispatch — and
do not silently skip the dispatch step.** If the sandbox/approval blocks it,
surface the blocker and ask; never quietly fall back to implementing the slice
yourself or abandoning the delegation.

- **Codex:** run from the worktree/repo root with `sandbox=workspace-write`,
  `sandbox_workspace_write.network_access=true`, and `approval-policy=on-request`.
- **Claude Code:** approve the `dispatch-task.sh` Bash invocation when prompted.

The user's explicit approval is required before any credential-backed dispatch
(AGENTS.md §"Credential & token handling").

## Watching a dispatched worker — judge idle time, never wall-clock

The worker streams its activity into a per-slice progress log at
`$PURECUT_WORKTREE_BASE/SLUG.progress.log` (path echoed at dispatch time; the
raw event stream is kept beside it at `….progress.log.ndjson`). Long slices
are normal: a healthy worker can run 10+ minutes while emitting a steady drip
of `[note]`/`[tool]`/`[gen]` lines.

- Dispatch in the background with output redirected to a file; do not block a
  foreground shell call (with its own timeout) on the whole slice.
- Poll `scripts/worker-status.sh --slug SLUG` every 30–60s. It is instant and
  bounded — safe to call as often as needed.
- **Patience rule: never kill a worker because of total elapsed time.** Act
  only on the probe's state:
  - `running` — leave it alone, whatever the runtime.
  - `stale` (no progress for 5+ minutes) — inspect the log tail and the
    worktree diff before deciding; a build or install step can legitimately
    be quiet for a while. Kill only if clearly wedged.
  - `verifying` — worker done, independent build gate running.
  - `done` — read the dispatch report and start the review.
- `[tool]` lines are tool calls observed by the harness — the model cannot
  fake or forget them, so they are the reliable liveness signal. `[note]`
  lines are the worker narrating its phases.

## Verify before you accept

A green build is not evidence the change is correct. On #455 every slice compiled,
passed its own tests, passed `npm run build`, and passed e2e — and the user still
found two real bugs within five minutes of using the app. Neither was a worker
mistake. Both were review-design mistakes: the review checked the *control* rather
than the *effect*, and checked against the *plan* rather than against the
*neighbouring shipped feature*.

Run these on every slice that touches engine output or a user-facing control.
Cheapest first; stop when the slice genuinely has no surface for one.

### 1. Engine probe — numbers, no browser

Dump what the generator actually produces and diff it. Build the probe from the
slice's own test fixtures (take everything above the first `test*` function) so it
uses real project/tool/feature shapes rather than hand-rolled ones.

- **For any "unchanged" claim**, dump output as JSON on both branches and `diff`
  them across a fixture matrix — do not read the worker's regression test. On #455
  this confirmed direct mode byte-identical across 12 fixtures (open, closed,
  region-masked, multi-target, V-bit, multi-level stepdown).
- **For new geometry**, print the quantity that would physically go wrong — where
  the *cutter body* ends up, not where the tool centre is. A tool-centre bound is
  usually too loose to notice a wrong magnitude.
- **Compare against the nearest shipped analogue** on the same input. Trochoidal
  Engrave mirrors trochoidal Edge Route; the region overhang was a divergence from
  it, and measuring the two side by side would have shown it immediately. Any
  divergence must be explainable as deliberate, or it is a bug.

This has zero tooling risk and is where geometry defects actually live.

### 2. Assert the output changes — a permanent test, not scratch

For **every new operation parameter**, assert the generated toolpath differs when
the parameter differs. This catches the entire class of "the control writes the
field but nothing recomputes."

That bug is easy to ship because the field, the UI, and the generator can all be
correct while the change never reaches the generator.
`operationComputationEquals` in `src/app/useToolpathGeneration.ts` gates
regeneration off an explicit allowlist, and its comment says so directly: *"Any new
computation-relevant field added to Operation must be listed here."* Adding a field
to `Operation` and not to that list produces exactly this symptom.

**Whenever a slice adds a field to `Operation`, grep for every consumer before
accepting.** Use a sibling field as the probe — `grep -rl trochoidalCutWidth src`
found the allowlist *and* the operation booklet, which was also missing the new
strategy.

### 3. Drive the real app

A scratch Playwright spec, not the browser extension: it reuses the repo's
fixtures and seeding seam, runs headless, and exits cleanly. Exercise the new
control end to end, assert the output changed, and screenshot it to eyeball.

**Always use a dedicated port and an isolated server.** The default 1420 with
`reuseExistingServer` will silently attach to a dev server from another checkout
and test the wrong code.

```bash
PURECUT_E2E_PORT=1439 PURECUT_E2E_ISOLATED=1 npx playwright test <spec>
```

**Port hygiene — Playwright and Vite do leave strays that block the port.** Check
before, and always clean up after, even when the run passed:

```bash
lsof -ti tcp:1439 | xargs -r kill
```

Delete the scratch spec once it has served its purpose; anything worth keeping
belongs in `e2e/*.smoke.spec.ts` as a real test.

### 4. Mutation-check the assertions that matter

A passing test constrains nothing until you have watched it fail. For the two or
three invariants the issue calls load-bearing, break the code on purpose and
confirm the test catches it.

On #455 the worker's region-polarity test passed 9/9 — and still passed with the
swept-half-width substitution *deleted entirely*, the one line the issue named as
"the one place a wrong sign silently cuts outside an include region."

**Restore from a `cp` backup, never `git checkout <file>`.** If the fix under test
is still uncommitted, `git checkout` discards it, and the next "mutation caught"
result is really just the reverted code. That happened, and it looked like a pass.

```bash
cp src/path/file.ts /tmp/file.fixed.ts   # before mutating
# …mutate, run the test, confirm it fails…
cp /tmp/file.fixed.ts src/path/file.ts   # restore
```

### Reviewing i18n

Diff locale files by **parsing key/value pairs on both sides and comparing the
dicts** — never by eyeballing the rendered diff. A worker repairing a parse error
with a Python heredoc silently swapped one space for U+00A0 inside an unrelated
pre-existing French string; it is invisible in `git diff`. Confirm each locale
gained only the intended keys and that no existing value changed. Note that locale
files do not share a quote style — `es/*` uses double quotes where others use
single — so match the file, not the sibling.

## Commands

```
# Dispatch one implement slice (after approval). Prompt on stdin.
scripts/dispatch-task.sh --issue NN --task-slug SLUG [--base BRANCH] < prompt.md
#   default --base: feat/core-arch-simplification
#   creates worktree at $PURECUT_WORKTREE_BASE/SLUG on feat/issue-NN-SLUG
#   runs the worker, then `npm run build` as an independent gate; never merges.

# Read-only review of an existing worktree (optional helper).
scripts/dispatch-task.sh --mode review --worktree DIR < prompt.md

# Poll a running dispatch (instant; see "Watching a dispatched worker").
scripts/worker-status.sh --slug SLUG

# Merge an approved slice and tear down its worktree (--no-ff).
scripts/finish-task.sh --slug SLUG [--base BRANCH]
#   refuses to merge into main/master without --allow-main.
#   also removes the slice's progress log artifacts.
```

The leaf launcher `scripts/run-claude-deepseek-agent.sh` (credential scrub,
worktree confinement, mode→permission mapping) is the trusted primitive both
scripts call. Do not modify it.

## Guardrails (enforced by the scripts — do not re-derive)

- Worktrees live under `$PURECUT_WORKTREE_BASE` — by default a `worktrees/<repo-name>`
  directory beside the repository — never the primary checkout or `main`.
- Branch-first, always: `feat/issue-NN-SLUG` off the integration branch.
- Independent build gate (`npm run build`) after the worker — the worker's
  reported checks are not trusted.
- `finish-task.sh` refuses to merge a dirty worktree or a dirty integration
  checkout, and refuses `main`/`master` without `--allow-main`.
- No Co-Authored-By lines, no "generated by" footers (AGENTS.md coding standards).
